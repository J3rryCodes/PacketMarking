# PacketMarking
Attacker Trace back using packet marking[XOR Method]

it's a program demonstrating Attacker trace back using packet marking technique .
-Sender sending packet to server . but to incress the speed of the server server is connecter with multipe router .
os if at the server we can't determine where is the source of received packets.

So each router in the system marking each packet that passing through it by XORing source IP with its own IP.

At the end(at server) we can reconstruct the path and can Trace back Attacker
